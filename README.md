SIMULATION OF ALGORITHMNS:
1) FCFS: THE PROCESS WHICH ARRIVES FIRST ARE SCHEDULED FIRST FOR ITS EXECUTION
2) SJF(SHORTEST JOB FIRST): THE PROCESS ARE SCHEDULED AS PER THE LOWEST BURST TIME WHICH MEANS THAT THE PROCESS WITH THE LOWEST BURST TIME ARE SCHEDULED FIRST
3) ROUND ROBIN: IN ROUND ROBIN SCHEDULING ALGORITHM THERE IS A TIME QUANTUM AND THE PROCESS ARE EXCETED FOR THE SPECIFIED TIME QUANTUM SO THAT ALL OTHER PROCESS GETS AT LEAST ONE CHANCE TO GET EXECUTED
4) PRIORITY SCHEDULING: IN PRIORITY SCHEDULING THE PROCESS WHICH THE LOWEST PRIORITY VALUE ARE SCHEDULED FIRST

ARRIVAL TIME: THE TIME AT WHICH THE PROCESS IS FIRST AVAILABLE IN THE READY QUEUE
BURST TIME: THE INTERVAL FOR WHICH THE PROCESS IS BEING EXECUTED
COMPLETION TIME: THE TIME AT WHICH THE PROCESS COMPLETES ITS EXECUTION
TURN AROUND TIME : THE TIME
